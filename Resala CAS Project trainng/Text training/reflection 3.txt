Reflection 3: Making a Plan and Working as a Team (LO4 & LO5)
Date: November 15, 2025CAS Strand: Service

I kept working on the bag problem at Resala. Today, I made a simple plan: use colored stickers to show if a bag is “not started,” “being sorted,” “ready,” or “no good.” I also wanted to mark areas on the floor for different steps.

I worked with 3 other volunteers (LO5). We tested my plan on 50 bags. We used stickers and made a clear 10x10 foot space. It made sorting 30% faster and much safer—no more tripping! We had to talk clearly and share jobs. When stickers finished, we found another way.

This teamwork helped clothes reach people faster. I will keep coming back (LO4) to make this system bigger for the whole charity.
