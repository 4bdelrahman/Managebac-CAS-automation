Description and Goals
As part of my community service, I volunteered with Resala Charity Organization (جمعية رسالة) to support their clothing donation initiative. My main tasks included collecting, sorting, and organizing donated clothes to ensure they were clean and suitable for redistribution to families in need. This experience allowed me to develop collaboration and organizational skills, as I worked with a team of volunteers to classify clothing by size and type. It also deepened my understanding of social responsibility and empathy, as I directly contributed to helping underprivileged communities.

Through this experience, I learned the importance of teamwork, efficiency, and community engagement in humanitarian projects, and how small actions can collectively make a meaningful difference.
