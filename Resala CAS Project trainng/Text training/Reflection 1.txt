My time volunteering at Resala showed me the main problem with the donation system: organization. As the pictures prove, the current process is inefficient. We have many generic, white bags of clothes piled up everywhere, which makes the floor messy and creates safety issues. Because volunteers have to constantly lift and move heavy bags without a clear plan, the work is unnecessarily hard. Crucially, there's no standardized system, like a simple way to label bags to show their status (unsorted, in progress, or ready to go). This lack of a clear workflow slows everything down, meaning resources take longer to reach families in need. Therefore, my project will focus on fixing this. I plan to initiate a systematic labeling process and reorganize the staging area to make sorting faster and safer for all volunteers.
