Reflection 2: Finding Problems and Staying Strong (LO1 & LO2)
Date: October 17, 2025CAS Strand: Service

At Resala Charity, while sorting clothes (تفريز الملابس), I saw a big problem: too many white bags with no labels. They were all over the floor, making it messy and unsafe. Volunteers kept tripping, and it was hard to know which bags were done or still needed work. This slowed everyone down.

I spotted this problem (LO1) and decided to help. I spent 2 hours moving bags and making small groups. I also talked to the team leader about using labels. It was tiring, but my area became cleaner and safer. This showed me how one small fix can help the whole team. Now I want to make a full labeling system.
